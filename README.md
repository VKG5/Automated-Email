# Automated-Email
A program to send emails via a python script, with a one file-attachment feature.

The program is quite easy to understand, I've put explanatory comments for every piece of code that needs to be changed.

Enjoy, any and all modifications are welcome, just don't forget to credit me for the amount of work I've done?
